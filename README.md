Robin wants to add more to her Mars web app.  She wantes to add all 4 Mars hemisphers to her app.
We will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

We will be creating:
Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
